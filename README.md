# Non-Hermitian topological phase transition detection through transport measurements
We explore a Rashba nanowire strongly coupled to a ferromagnet threaded by an axial magnetic field. The system exhibits a non-Hermitian topological phase transition, which is reflected in the asymmetric behavior of non-local conductance.
